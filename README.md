# hello-world
KOHAKU's first repository

I just want to have a little change about this file. And let me do an introcution. I am now a university student in Asia and I am not good at English but Japanese, so if there is anyone from Japan or know Japanese, I'll be glad to talk with you. 
I like programming despite the fact that I do not major in Computer Science. I also hope that everyone here can help me improving my programming skills. 
That's all thank you!
